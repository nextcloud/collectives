# CollectiveWiki

The CollectiveWiki app provides simple wiki functionalities to collectives.
It facilitates to record and organize knowledge in a collaborative way.

* **Collective and non-hierarchical workflow by heart**: Wikis are tied to
  a [Nextcloud Circle](https://github.com/nextcloud/circles) and owned by
  the collective.
* **Collaborative page editing** like known from Etherpad thanks to the
  [Text app](https://github.com/nextcloud/text)
* **Well-known [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax**
  for page formatting

## Requirements

This app builds on the functionality of the Circles and the Text App.
They both need to be installed for CollectiveWiki to work properly.

## Installation

The app is *not* published yet to the Nextcloud app store, so you have to
install it manually:

1. Clone this into the `apps` folder of your Nextcloud
2. Install PHP dependencies by running `make composer`
3. Install NodeJS dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Compile NodeJS assets by running `make npm`
5. Compile translation files by running `make l10n`

Afterwards, you can enable the app from the Nextcloud app management menu.

### Development environment

Development environments often do not use proper hostnames
and are not using ssl.
In order to make the Circles API work in such environments
a few configuration settings need to be adjusted.

You can do so by running the following commands on the nextcloud server:
```
./occ config:system:set --type bool --value true -- allow_local_remote_servers
./occ config:app:set --value 1 -- circles self_signed_cert
./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 allow_non_ssl_links
./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 local_is_non_ssl
```

## Development Background: Circle and user management

In Nextcloud, every file/folder is owned by a user. Even when shared with a
circle, the ultimate power over this object remains at the owner user. In
collective workflows, this leads to several problems. Instead of individual
users, we want the documents to be owned and maintained by the collective.
Since this concept is unsupported by the Nextcloud and Circles per default,
we plan to implement it on our own.

Current status: Creating a new wiki internally does the following:

2. Create a vehicle circle `<NAME>`
3. Create a wiki folder `<NAME>`
4. Share the wiki folder with the vehicle circle

Planned: Creating a new wiki internally does the following:

1. Create a vehicle user `wiki@<NAME>@<UUID>` (with random UUID as password)
2. Create a vehicle circle `<NAME>` with the vehicle user as owner
3. Create a wiki folder `<NAME>` with the vehicle user as owner
4. Share the wiki folder with the vehicle circle
