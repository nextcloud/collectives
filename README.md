# Collectives

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud/collectives)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud/collectives)

Collectives is a Nextcloud App for activist and community projects to
organize together. Come and gather in collectives to build shared knowledge.

* 👥 **Collective and non-hierarchical workflow by heart**: Collectives are
  tied to a [Nextcloud Team](https://github.com/nextcloud/circles) and
  owned by the collective.
* 📝 **Collaborative page editing** like known from Etherpad thanks to the
  [Text app](https://github.com/nextcloud/text).
* 🔤 **Well-known [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax**
  for page formatting.
* 🔎 Full-text search with automatic indexing to find content straight away.
